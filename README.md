## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flex box fluently, as well as using clamp() to adjust responsive easier, and write css file more cleaner. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 3em;

  font-size: clamp(3em, 1.5vw, 5em);
}
```

### Continued development

I will create multiple cards like this and display in a grid in future.
